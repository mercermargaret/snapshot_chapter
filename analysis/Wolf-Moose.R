# Wolf: with higher human disturbance, large peak in morning activity shifts from 7am to 9am; afternoon activity dips a bit
# Moose: with higher human disturbance, AM activity (8am) peaks and 6pm peak shifts to 11pm. Midday peak remains constant but dips before and after much sharper in high dist
# Overlap in high vs low: overlap greater in areas of LOWER disturbance (p value < 0.01)
